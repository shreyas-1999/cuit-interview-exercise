# 1. Overview
This exercise implements a simple web-app to partially display Cardiff University's Open Day information, sourced from a JSON file (OpenDay.json). The application features a home page with a grid of topic tiles, with search and sorting implemented. The implementation uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend, with a Python Flask server to serve the JSON data.

# 2. Features

## a. Header:
A header with a topics dropdown shows a list of all the topics available for the CU Open Day event. hovering over the topics shows a sub-section of all the programs under that topic. This section is followed by a banner image.

## b. Tiles Grid:
Displays all topics in a responsive grid.
Each tile includes an image, title, description, start/end date-time, and a "More Info" button.
More Info button would Ideally take the user to a new page that shows a similar grid with tiles of all the 'programs' under the selected Topic. This has not been implemented yet due to time constraint.

## c. Search Functionality:
A search bar allows users to filter topics by matching terms in the topic name (title) or description (short description).
Case-insensitive search with a "Clear" button to reset the filter.

## d. Sort Functionality:
A dropdown to sort topics by:
* Title (A-Z or Z-A).
* Start Date (Earliest or Latest).
Sorting applies to filtered search results too.

# User Guide to run the Exercise
## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on the system.
* Web browser (tested on chrome and edge)

## Install Dependencies
* Install Flask and flask-cors:
```bash
pip install flask flask-cors
```

## Start the Flask server
open the terminal in the 'backend' directory and run the server.py file.
```bash
python server.py
```
The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000. We can test the API by running http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/openday in the browser, which should display the JSON data.

The front-end files need to be served over HTTP due to CORS restrictions. Open a new terminal in the 'backend' directory and run the following command to run Pythonâ€™s built-in HTTP server:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Open the browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000. The home page should load with the topic tiles. If the data fails to load, check the error messages in the console and run the server in debug mode.

# Frameworks Used
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the front-end structure, styling, and functionality.
Bootstrap 5.3.5 (CDN): For responsive design and UI components.
jQuery 3.7.1 (CDN): For DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.
Flask: Python framework to create a simple API server.
flask-cors: To handle CORS and allow cross-origin requests.
